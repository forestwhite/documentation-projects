Overview

<p>
  A good number of the bugs that have recently been found in our code have been due to
  memory leaks.  This tutorial will go over textbook and actual examples of how to find and
  fix a memory leak.  Memory leaks are the current number-one cause of server malfunction;
  it is imperative that every developer using C++ learn how to do this and apply it to everything
  they write.</p>

              <a name="Label">A Textbook Example</a></font>
              <p>The textbook example is something like this - a pointer is created at the beginning of
                the function and that pointer is deleted at the end of the function. However, in the middle of the function,
                some flow control checks for an exit condition, halting the function if an error occurs.  This check doesn't
                delete anything and the code returns without deleting the pointer.  This is a common error when modifying
                large pieces of code.
                <br><br>
                The following is a code segment with a memory/pointer leak:<code><pre>{
                <br>    ebay_ostrstream *pEnvXML = new ebay_ostrstream(); <font color="blue">//remember to delete the pointer before exiting this scope</font>
                <br>    *pEnvXML &lt;&lt; &quot;this is something or another&quot;;
                <br>    char *temp = pEnvXML->str();
                <br>    //...
                <br>    someFunctionOrAnother(temp);
                <br>    //...
                <br>    mpUser = mpUsers->GetUser(pUserId, false, false);
                <br>    if (!mpUser){
                <br>        MyeBayCommonErrorXML(ER_MYEBAYALL_NO_USER,
                XSLMyEbayAll,
                pXSLStyle,
                partnerId,
                siteId); <font color="red">//does not call delete pEnvXML, here is the leak</font>
                <br>        CleanUp();
                <br>        return;
                <br>    }
                <br>	//...
                <br>    pEnvXML->rdbuf()->freeze(false); <font color="red">//freeze is called too late</font>
                <br>    delete pEnvXML; <font color="blue">//delete is called at the end of the function.</font>
                <br>    CleanUp();
                <br>}
              </pre></code>
              <p>You can use a local stack variable instead of a pointer to avoid using delete at all.  It is not always necessary to use
                a pointer.  Most abuses of the "new" operator occur when a local variable should be used instead.
                <br><br>Here is a correct version of the same function:</p> <code><pre>{
                <br>    <font color="green">ebay_ostrstream EnvXML; </font><font color="blue">//initialize a variable, not a pointer</font>
                <br>    EnvXML &lt;&lt; &quot;this is something or another&quot;;
                <br>    char *temp = EnvXML.str();
                <br>    //...
                <br>    someFunctionOrAnother(temp);
                <br>    <font color="green">EnvXML.rdbuf->freeze(false); </font><font color="blue">//Unfreeze the buffer as soon as possible after using it, this
                //prevents problems later</font>
                <br>    //...
                <br>    mpUser = mpUsers->GetUser(pUserId, false, false);
                <br>    if (!mpUser){
                <br>        MyeBayCommonErrorXML(ER_MYEBAYALL_NO_USER,
                XSLMyEbayAll,
                pXSLStyle,
                partnerId,
                siteId);
                <br>        <font color="green">CleanUp();</font> <font color="blue">//no delete is needed</font>
                <br>        return;
                <br>    }
                <br>    //...
                <br>    CleanUp();
                <br>}</pre></code>
                <p>This solution is the most recommended.  If a local variable was not usable, you would delete the pointer in any code
                  block that would exit the function.  Notice also that the buffer for the variable is unfrozen as soon as the variable was used.
                  This frees the variable to be used in another function (such as delete).  The problem with unfreezing the buffer later, as shown
                  in the first example, is that the CleanUp function in the if(!mpUser) block may not have been able to deallocate the variable.</p>

                  <a name="Vector">Vector Data Structures</a></font>
                  <p>Vectors are convenient and elegant data structures, but the improper use of a vector can
                    tie up memory just as easily as a standard pointer.  The member objects of a vector are not deallocated when the vector
                    is deallocated.  They must be deallocated as well.</p>
                    <p>An example of vector leaking in Cls***name omitted***.cpp:<br>
                      <code><pre>if (!mpUser) && (mpItem->GetAuctionType() == ItemFixedPrice) && !(mpItem->WasListedAfterCheckout())){
                        <br>    BidVector vFinalBids; <font color="blue">//remember to clear it before the function ends</font>
                        <br>    //...
                        <br>    txnHistoryResult.CopyFinalBidsVectortoTransactionsVector(vFinalBids,
                        (int)userType); <font color="red">//bid objects are allocated
                        //and placed in the vFinalBids vector
                        //but are not freed after that</font>
                        <br>    <font color="blue">//the vFinalBids vector is cleared by the implicit destructor</font>
                        <br>}
                      </pre></code>
                      <p>In the above example, objects are associated with the vector in a function call but are not deallocated.  In order to properly
                        use this vector, the member objects need to be deleted separately before the vector is deallocated.  This is accomplished with a
                        simple loop and the proper pointer variable reference, as seen below.<br>
                        <code><pre>if (mpItem && (mpItem->GetAuctionType() == ItemFixedPrice) && !(mpItem->WasListedAfterCheckout())){
                          <br>    BidVector vFinalBids;

                          <br>    txnHistoryResult.CopyFinalBidsVectortoTransactionsVector(vFinalBids,
                          (int)userType);

                          <br>    for (iBid = vFinalBids.begin(); iBid != vFinalBids.end(); iBid ++)
                          <br>        delete (*iBid);</font> <font color="blue">//delete the objects one at a time with a loop</font>

                          <br>}
                        </pre></code>
                        <p>Objects arranged in a vector do not always have their own destructor, either by design or because of some sloppy
                          programming.  Always assume that they do not destroy themselves.  The author of the class to create these objects
                          cannot always anticipate how the functions will be used so it is your responsibility, if you wish to use the class, to
                          make sure the objects are deallocated properly.</p>

                          <p>Pointers that store the location of an object or parts of an object can keep portions of memory in existence unless
                            they are freed.  It is not uncommon to reference information using a pointer and then forget to free the pointer before leaving
                            the scope.  This can cause a pointer to remain after it is no longer useful and the object corresponding to that pointer to remain
                            allocated in memory.</p>

                            <p>GetItem is a member function of the clsItems class that creates a clsItem object.  GetItem
                              will not cleanup the item object it allocates before it is finished executing.  In the example below, mpItem, a pointer to a
                              clsItem object, is never freed.  Therefore, GetItem holds onto the information, waiting for it to be used. Errors of this kind
                              leave data in memory that will be lost.  Any time GetItem or GetUser is called, memory is allocated and needs to be freed.

                            <p>A leak example with mpUser:<code><pre>clsItem *pBlockedItem = mpItems->GetItem(mpItem->GetId(), false, NULL, 0, true);<font color="blue">if (mpItem</font>

                              <br>    success = false;

                              should be released with a "delete /*object name*/" call.  CleanUp will dissolve all of the objects in the current
                              heap and is sometimes too general for use.</p>

                              <p>This is a very simple example but represents over 18% of the memory leaks found in the last year.  Do not forget to free your
                                pointers before exiting a function.</p>
                                <!-- ********** Header 2 ******************** -->
                                <p></p><hr><font class="subhead2">
                                <a name="GetUser"> Overwriting Pointers and Data (with GetUser)</a></font>
                                <p>This is a more complicated example of the problem mentioned in the previous section.  Freeing a variable is particularly
                                  critical with object element pointers if the parent object is overwritten but the pointer to an element in that object is not.
                                  You end up with a leftover object with no pointer to it.  This type of memory leak comprises only about 5% of the memory leaks
                                  found in the last year but they fill memory just like other memory leaks.</p>

                                  <p>GetUser is a member function of the clsUsers class that creates a clsUser object.  GetUser
                                    will not clean up the clsUser object it allocates before it is finished executing.  In the following example, mpUser remains
                                    pointing at an object element whose pointer is overwritten by another function before being freed.  Errors of this kind leave
                                    spots in memory that hold information that is either no longer valid or should have been retained.  Any time a pointer is
                                    overwritten, the previous object the pointer was pointing to will still have memory assigned to it if it is not freed.  It is
                                    imperative that a pointer not be overwritten until an object it points to is freed in memory.  In the case of GetUser and GetItem,
                                    the objects they create are not cleaned up until they complete.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>Another leak example with mpUser:</p>

                                    </pre></code>
                                    <p>In the example above, GetAndCheckUserAndPassword creates a clsUser object using getUser.  A pointer from that object in the
                                      mpUsers field is passed to the mpUser variable.  OptinLogin handles a change to the clsUser object, including the pointer held
                                      in the mpUsers field.  mpUser still holds a pointer from the original clsUser object and now points to old data.
                                      The memory for the first object's field remains allocated even though the clsUser object has been changed.  At the end of
                                      the function, CleanUp cleans up the new clsUser object (by allowing getUser to complete) and cleans up mpUser, but does not clean
                                      up the original mpUsers field that remains in memory.  Even though mpUser is deallocated after OptinLogin was called, the object it
                                      points to is a field of some object no longer referred to.  Therefore, as getUser completes, it deallocates the current clsUser
                                      object and the things its fields currently point to.</p>

                                      <p>To remedy this, free up the memory allocated for the first object before changing it or creating a new one.  If you need
                                        the information from the previous object, store the information in a local variable, not a pointer.  Making another call to
                                        getUser will not free up the memory on its own.  A Cleanup() can be executed before the data objects are used again.  This frees
                                        mpUser and allows getUser to complete before calling getUser again with OptinLogin.</p>

                                        <p>Here is a correct example:</p>
                                        <code><pre>void clseBayApp::ChangeEmail2Show(CEBayISAPIExtension *pServer, char *pUserId, char *pPass, char *pEmail2)

                                          <br>    mpUser = mpUsers->GetAndCheckUserAndPassword(pUserId,

                                          <br>    OptinLogin(pServer,
                                          pUserId,
                                          pPass,
                                          /*filter*/ 0,
                                          /*showHeader*/ false);
                                          <br>    CleanUp();

                                        </pre></code>
                                        <p>This results in a new clsUsers object being created when OptinLogin is called.  Although this is another query to the local
                                          database, it poses less of a problem for performance than a memory leak.  Another way to handle this would be to use the pointer
                                          in mpUser to find the parent object and deallocate it manually.  This would still have to happen before the call to OptinLogin and
                                          would be more cumbersome.  You could also create a variable to hold the pointer to the original clsObject but this is only useful
                                          if you wish to refer to the object after the processes before the call to OptinLogin.</p>

                                          <p>
                                            LeakDiag is a new beta tool from Microsoft to diagnose memory leaks. It provides stack traces with line numbers for
                                            the leaks. The UI is different for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0, but works on both platforms. On Windows 2000
                                            development boxes, it runs very fast. On a Windows NT 4.0 production platform, it takes a long time to dump the leaks out (up to
                                            two hours) so if you use it on production be patient.
