<h3 class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Why We Study Theory</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The most
infuriating aspect of literary theory and criticism is the resistance to
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In most cases when a student is
excited about what they are learning, others tend to entertain discussions with
them about the concepts that have captured their interest in order to learn
from what they have learned and to assist them in solidifying their
understanding of the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the
case of literary theory, I have met with so much resistance to even mentioning
it that I was forced to escape into my room for 48 hours, studying theory to
wit’s end without the aid of perspectives other than my own.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The challenge to literary theory from my
usual social circles is that theory and criticism “spits in the face” of all
literary endeavors by trivializing, over-analyzing, and reading far too much
into them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This ultimately led me to
ask – does theory and criticism serve any purpose other than those noted
above?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the people who are so opposed
to literary theory utilize a poetic method of analysis based upon the ideology
of expressive realism with occasional jaunts into a psychoanalytic
ideology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because most of the theory
that is studied in academia has been compared to this ideology, I will present
my own case for the learning, pursuit of, and creation of theory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There is
not written or spoken word that is not intended for an audience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We begin understanding language to perform
the function of communicating with others and eventually tend to use it to
speak to others ourselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whether the
intended reader or listener is labeled as a subject, a homosexual, a college
professor, or that special someone, all authors and orators offer their work to
the scrutiny of anyone who is witness to their communications.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All readers, internally or otherwise, are
critics of the creator’s work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anyone
comes away from any communication with an impression.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is often the objective of many writers to refine their writing
ability to the point where they can evoke specific reactions and criticisms
through their work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So then, as you
read this, you will come away with a idea of what was said, what you thought of
it, and maybe even tell the author later through evaluation notes or direct
verbal contact what you would have changed about it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Thus you are a critic whenever you read.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It might also be noted that you would be
practicing a hermeneutic method of initial evaluation – that is, taking this
text and deriving meaning or concepts from it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Furthermore, your criticism will be based upon your individual and
societal ideologies, or theories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Therefore, criticism <i>is the application of </i>theory.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Without theory, critics pose no point, have
no objectives, and will have little else to say when they mutter, “This essay
sucks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This would
bring us to the first beneficial reason why theory and criticism is
applied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the sake of authors, it is
good that we have critics to evaluate our work.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Just as students help other students to understand their studies
by offering alternate perspectives, so does the critic offer to the author a
perspective on their work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This can be
easily demonstrated within the creative literature classes that refine a
writer’s abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The guidelines for
critical writing were outlined in the syllabus of one poetry workshop with this
rule:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>… on his/her first readings, the author is not
allowed to explain the work, defend the work, or answer questions about the
work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is intended to allow the
author to witness the effect of the poem on the audience and gauge the effectiveness
of his/her intention without swaying the listeners’ opinions … (Greene,
“Workshop Guidelines-LTCR 3-Creative Writing: Poetry-Fall 1999, p.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This method is based upon the theoretical discourses of the
New Critics who criticized literature differently from the expressive
realists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An author’s intent in the
expressive realistic theory goes unquestioned – any work was to be an accurate
representation of the “real.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But the
new critics developed the idea of the “Intentional Fallacy,” from which the aforementioned
rule is a derivative, by asserting that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Knowledge of the authors intentions was ‘neither
available or desirable (Wimsatt 1970, p. 3) … Further, the pursuit of
‘sincerity’, ‘spontaneity’, ‘authenticity’, or other expressive values
associated with the intentionalism had no relation to the more precise and
truly critical values of ‘integrity’, ‘unity’, ‘maturity’, and ‘subtlety’ (<i>ibid</i>,
p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The latter were properties not
of the author but of the text.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>(Cathrine Belsey, <i>Critical Practice</i> (London &amp; New York:
Routlage, 1980) p. 15)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, creative writing professors would not have a
valuable method of refining a student’s writing had it not been for a more
critical analysis of literature than the expressive realists could
provide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is one way in which the
application of theory, criticism, can benefit a writer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We would
continue now into other fields of human conduct and participation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The most open field, though probably not the
friendliest, is society and politics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>One cannot deny that social interaction is largely based upon some form
of communication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Among all of the ways
we communicate, the most likely candidates for the most common are speech and
the written word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“How far are people
constructed as subjects by cultural forms and practices which ‘interpolate’ or
address them <i>as</i> people with particular desires or values?” (Jonathan
Culler, <i>Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction</i>, (New York, Oxford,
1997) p. 46)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Semiotics, or the study of
signs and symbols, was introduced by the linguist Saussure who testified that
meaning was constructed outside of reality and instead in thoughts and
signs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His work has been as inspiration
to several theorists to develop certain ideas that would eventually lead to a
better understanding of meaning and its relation to society and thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One so inspired – Haig A Bosmajian, a
professor in the Department of Speech Communication at the University of
Washington – took Saussure’s theory to imply another meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Labels like ‘traitors,’ ‘saboteurs,’ ‘queers,’ and
‘obscene degenerates’ were applied indiscriminately to students who protested the
war in Vietnam or denounced injustices in the United States.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Are such people to be listened to?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consulted?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Argued with?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Obviously not!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One does not listen to, much less talk to,
traitors and outlaws, sensualists and queers … Just as our thoughts affect our
language, so does our language affect our thoughts and eventually our actions
and behavior … Hitler’s ‘Final Solution’ appeared reasonable once the Jews were
successfully labeled by the Nazis as sub-humans, as ‘parasites,’ ‘vermin,’ and
‘bacilli’ (Haig A Bosmajian, <i>The Language of Oppression</i> (New York:
Alfred A. Knopf, 1974), p. 6-7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Language would then appear to be so powerful in creating
meaning that it can cause such great atrocities as the holocaust.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Prof. Bosmajian is not alone in his
theories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, as he reveals the
ways in which language has been used to create negative social change, others
propose that language could be an appropriate vehicle for more positive changes
as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>A man may take to drink because he feels himself a
failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is rather the same thing that is
happening to the English Language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the
slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts …
silly expressions have often disappeared, not through any evolutionary process
but owing to the conscious action of a minority. (George Orwell, <i>“Politics
and the English Language,” </i>in C. Muscatine and M. Griffith, <i>The Borzoi
College Reader, 7<sup>th</sup> ed. </i>(McGraw-Hill, Inc.: L Denton and D.
Dunham), p. 185)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the minorities that Orwell may have been referring
to, women, has spoken, at least in par, also of their quest for deliberate
social change through language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
1971, the president of the National Organization for Women, Wilma Heide,
realized a methodology for social change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Instead of passively noting the change [in society],
we are changing language patterns to actively affect the changes, a significant
part of which is the conceptual tool of thought, our language (Wilma Scott
Heide, “Feminism: The <i>sine qua non </i>for a Just Society,” <i>Vital
Speeches</i>, 38(1971-72), p. 402).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This theory can be used to banish many of the presuppositions
and prejudices of our society, which would allow us to live more harmonious and
civilized lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Comments such as
“Don’t mind her, she’s just a teenager” begin to reveal the true meanings of
words that go outside of the dictionary definition.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>A teenager, in this case, is meant to imply immaturity,
fickleness, lack of responsibility, a rebellious nature, and a lack of meritable
opinion or thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The time when we
are teenagers is constructed into a period in everyone’s life during which we
have distinct lack of judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is
even used as an insult among adults.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This may be more indicative of our current social problems of teenage
suicide, pregnancy, drug abuse, media affected distortions of the body, and the
generalization of authorities and police of teenagers as “being up to no good.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One of the
best examples of a social movement within the literary community is the
feminist movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It encompasses
perhaps some of the finest examples of criticism with a distinct point and
effect on out society and the way people think.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In fact, Maria Lugones and Elizabeth Spelman co-wrote an essay
that addresses the contest that theory serves no good purpose by creating a set
of goals that all theorists should strive for – should they wish to theorize
with some intent in mind rather than mere observation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within these standards, I’m sure there are a
few reasons why literary theory is a useful and fruitful exploit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
theory or account can be helpful if it enables one to see how parts of one’s
life fit together … 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A useful theory
will help locate oneself concretely in the world, rather than add to the
mystification of the world one’s located in … 3.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>A theory or account … ought to … enable one to think about the
extent to which one is responsible or for being in that location … 4.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>… a theory that is useful will provide
criteria for change and make suggestions for modes of resistance that don’t
merely reflect the situation and values of the theorizer … 5.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Theory cannot be useful to anyone interested
in resistance and change unless there is reason to believe that knowing what a
theory means and believing it to be true have some connection to resistance and
change (M. Lugones and E. Spelman, “Have We Got a Theory for You!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Feminist Theory, Cultural Imperialism and
the Demand for ‘The Woman’s Voice’”, in M. Pearsall’s <i>Women and Values:

<p class=MsoNormal>These two feminist theorists seem to be as concerned with
the merit of theory as those would challenge it are.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is also notable that I have seen quite a bit of applicable
theory being created from the feminist camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The use of post-structuralist theory, specifically deconstruction, is
notable on the part of Joan W. Scott.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In her deconstruction of the patriarchal language constructs of
polarity, the notion that everything has a direct and equal opposite, she
effectively shows how justice in a court case concerning equal opportunity
could have been accomplished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In the past few years, ‘equality vs. difference’ has
been shorthand to characterize conflicting feminist positions and political
strategies … it makes no sense for the feminist movement to let its arguments
be forced into pre-existing categories and its political disputes to be characterized
by a dichotomy we did not invent … In this usage, the opposite of equality is
inequality or inequivalence (Joan W. Scott, “Deconstructing
Equality-Versus-Difference”, M. Hirsch and E. Keller’s <i>Conflicts in Feminism</i>,
(New York &amp; London: Hirsch and Keller, 1988) p. 138-42).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her contribution demonstrates a “theory that will be useful
and relevant for political practice” (<i>ibid</i>., p. 134). In this way,
feminist theory is relevant and applicable to improving itself and creating
better political strategies for effective change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There are
“theorists” who deny any relevance of theory as it applies to them or
especially as it applies to writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They claim that criticism as a practice has become self-reflexive and
thus loses its worth as tool to teach writers, only retaining its worth as a
tool to teach critics to debate with other critics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Critics are no longer concerned with literature but
with other critics’ texts, for the critic yearning for attention has displaced
the writer and has conceived of himself as the center.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interestingly in the first part of the [20<sup>th</sup>]
century, at least in England and America, the critic was usually also a writer
of poetry, plays, or novels (Barbara Christian, “The Race for Theory”, A
JanMohamed and D. Lloyd’s <i>Cultural Critique, </i>(New York: Telos Press,
19??) p. 52).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Criticism may also lose some of its social worth as it
detaches readers from literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Literature, more so than theory, is directly communicated from our
society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is, in essence, an
undertaking of explanation and consideration for the now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Theory cannot evolve any more than
literature can without fresh and pertinent material.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>If literature is about out changing world than theory is about
the changing world of literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But,
as I have said before, reading, in essence, is a critical process.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It could be said that if professors and
educators had not criticism of opinion of the literary theories presented to
them, that they would not be able to teach it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Christian’s commentary could be thought of as a critical analysis of
context or a historical perspective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She criticizes critics’ criticism of other critics.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But, without being able to discuss or debate
theory with one’s peers (as I have been forced to do), one would be inhibiting
the critical process that led us to theories that are more applicable now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are not applicable at the time they
were written much in the same way Trigonometry was not linked to the
mathematical representation of waves when Pythagoras discovered it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And were it not for the applicable theory
that came before, we may be worse off.</p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology [idiom
or familiar language] has gone some distance towards turning himself into a
machine, the appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx but his brain is
not involved as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the speech he is making is one that he is
accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of what he
is saying, as one is when on utters the responses in church.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And this reduced state of consciousness, if
not dispensable, is at any rate favourable to political conformity. … This
invasion of one’s mind by ready-made phrases (<i>lay the foundation,achieve a

against them, and every such phrase anaesthetizes a portion of one’s brain
